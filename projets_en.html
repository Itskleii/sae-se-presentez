      <h3>Colmar</h3>
      <p>
        I chose to do the B.U.T. in Networks and Telecommunications because I've been passionate about IT for years, and then I discovered networks through my NSI courses. It was a chapter that I understood and that I found interesting. That's why I decided to do this course. At the end of secondary school, I passed my baccalaur√©at, as well as the abitur, which is the German equivalent, and that's why I decided to do the <a href="https://www.iutcolmar.uha.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RT-BUT-ICS-MAI-2021.pdf" target="_blank">ICS</a> course. The idea is that I'll do my first year in France, the second in Germany and the third in Switzerland. At the end of the three years, I'll still have to do a six-month placement in a German or Swiss company.

    <h3>After that ?</h3>
    <p>
      After that, I'd like to continue my studies, in a Masters or an engineering school. Still in IT and networks. For me, continuing my studies is important and will open up more doors for me professionally. One possibility would be the SUPINFO school, either in systems and networks expertise, or in cybersecurity. These are two branches that I find interesting, and that have a promising future.

  <h3>For wich job ?</h3>
  <p>
    Finally, I'm interested in working as a systems and network engineer, or network administrator, because these jobs bring together several areas that I enjoy and find interesting. Doing this job in a company interests me and will allow me to discover new things. What's more, these are jobs that require constant training in new technological developments, and that appeals to me even more.
